# Deck Quickstart

Welcome to [Deck](https://deck.co)'s Quickstart! This repo contains folders: **nodejs/**. 

Each folder contains a minimal full-stack app that does the following: 
1. Set up your webhook 
2. Obtain an access token using the Deck Widget
3. Obtain user-permissioned data from the Deck API

To get started, clone the repository, `cd` into one the folder, and follow the instructions in the corresponding **README**. Enjoy! 

```
git clone https://github.com/datadeckapi/quickstart.git && cd ./quickstart
```

If you're looking for a more fully-featured quickstart, covering more API endpoints, available in more languages, and with explanations of the underlying flows, see the official [Deck Quickstart](https://docs.deck.co/docs/setup).
